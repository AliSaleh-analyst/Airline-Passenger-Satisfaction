✈️ Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction using MySQL to uncover actionable insights from survey data. Through 75+ SQL queries, I explored:

* How flight delays, seat comfort, and service quality impact satisfaction

* Demographic trends (age, gender, loyalty status)

* Critical pain points for dissatisfied passengers

* Opportunities for airlines to improve customer experience

+ Why it matters: Airlines can use these findings to reduce churn, prioritize upgrades, and enhance operational decisions.

🔍 Key Findings
* Worst services: Inflight Wi-Fi (2.8/5) and gate location (3.1/5)

* Delays >30 mins reduce satisfaction by 40%

* Business class passengers are 25% more satisfied than economy

* Dissatisfaction clusters: "Uncomfortable" (32%), "Digital Pain" (18%)
